===      Bolverk Assembler v0.0.1     ===
===         By Andrew Buntine         ===
=========================================

1) Definition

  This is a compiler for an assembly-like language. It complies to the native Bolverk
  instruction set.

  An assembly language provides a level of abstraction above the target machines
  instruction set so we can write source in (slightly) more natural language opposed
  to directly in machine code.

  Comments are denoted by two hyphens and are terminated by the newline character.

  To make things easier for us humans (and lexical analysis), all numbers (memory
  cells, registers, etc) must be denoted in decimal.

2) Example

  -- Print the sum of two decimal numbers: (44 + 120).
  LOAD 1, 44
  LOAD 2, 120
  DADD 1, 2, 3   -- Add (as decimal) the contents of register 1 and 2. Store the result in register 3.
  STOR 3, 161
  PMDE 161       -- Print Memory cell 161 (A1) as decimal

3) TODO

  - Variables (immutable):
      A = 56
      LOAD 2, A
  - ASCII Character data type:
      PMCH '$'
