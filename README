===      Bolverk Assembler v0.0.1     ===

=========================================

1) Definition

  This is a compiler for an assembly-like language. It complies to the native Bolverk
  instruction set.

  An assembly language provides a level of abstraction above the target machines
  instruction set so we can write source in (slightly) more natural language opposed
  to directly in machine code.

  Comments are denoted by two hyphens and are terminated by the newline character.

2) Example

  -- Print the sum of two decimal numbers.
  LOAD 1, 43
  LOAD 2, 0D
  BADD 1, 2, 3   -- Add (as Binary) the contents of register 1 and 2. Store the result in register 3.
  STOR 3, A1
  PMDE A1        -- Print Memory cell A1 as DEcimal
