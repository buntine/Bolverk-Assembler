=========================================

1) Definition

  This is a compiler for an assembly-like language. It compiles to the native Bolverk
  instruction set.

  An assembly language provides a level of abstraction above the target machines
  instruction set so we can write source in (slightly) more natural language opposed
  to directly in machine code.

  Comments are denoted by two hyphens and are terminated by the newline character.

  To make things easier for us humans (and lexical analysis), all numbers (memory
  cells, registers, etc) must be denoted in decimal.

  Any storable decimal number can be replaced with it's ASCII equivelant. Characters
  must be wrapped in single quotes.

  The machine accepts 8-bit signed integers. Therefore the range is -128..127, which
  should be enough for purely educational purposes.

  See ./LANGUAGE_SPEC for more info and a list of primitive procedures.

2) Example

  -- Print the sum of two decimal numbers: (-10 + 120) with much excitement.
  VALL 1, -10
  VALL 2, 120
  VALL 4, '!'
  BADD 1, 2, 3   -- Add (as binary) the contents of register 1 and 2. Store the result in register 3.
  STOR 3, 160
  STOR 4, 161
  PMDE 160       -- Print Memory cell 160 (A0) as decimal.
  PMCH 161       -- Print Memory cell 161 (A1) as an ASCII character.
  HALT


  -- Or, the same thing but more succinct:
  VALL 1, -10
  VALL 2, 120
  PVDS 1, 2      -- Print to STDOUT, the sum of r1 and r2.
  PVCH '!'

3) Usage

  The compiler accepts a string or File-like object containing a (hopefully) valid program.

  assembler = Bolverk::ASM::Compiler.new(File.open("./sample.basm"))
  source = assembler.compile

  puts source
