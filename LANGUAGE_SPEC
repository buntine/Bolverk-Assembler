1) General notes

  - Traditionally, Assembly languages define a semi-direct mapping of names to native instructions, without
    more obvious abstractions. Bolverk Assembler follows along these lines.

  - All storable numbers, memory cells and registers are represented as demical integers. For example:
    - Register 1: 1
    - Register A: 10
    - Cell A0:    160
    - -20:        -20
    - 230:        ERROR! (cannot store)

  - Integers are 8-bit signed. This means we can only store -128 to 127 successfully. Anything outside of
    this range will cause a SemanticError exception during compilation.

  - Comments are denoted by two hyphens and terminated by the newline character. They can appear on their own
    lines or be appended to the end of another line.

  - ASCII-encoded characters can be referenced by enclosing them in single quotes. Only one character may appear
    at a time. Otherwise, a SyntaxError exception is caused.
    - LOAD 1, 'Y'  -- Valid
    - LOAD 2, 'O'  -- Valid
    - LOAD 3, 'YO' -- Syntax error
