- Modify compiler to only insert HALT if the hacker hasn't already done
  so (it's currently pushed onto the syntax tree during code generation).

- Add more tests
  - Test each primitive generates the correct target source.
  - Test compiler only adds HALT if necessary.

- Design/implement more primitive procedures:
     DMUL 1, 2, 3  -- Multiply the contents of r1 and r2, store the result in r3.

- Variables (immutable):
     A = 56
     LOAD 2, A

- Floating-point numbers:
     LOAD 4, 3.14
