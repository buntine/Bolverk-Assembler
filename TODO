- Due to a limitation in my grammar (all procedures must be followed by
  1+ arguments), the HALT instruction, which has no arguments, causes a
  syntactic error.
  - Fix grammer and parser to allow for procedures without arguments.
  - Modify compiler to only insert HALT if the hacker hasn't already done
    so (it's currently pushed onto the syntax tree during code generation).

- Write a LANGUAGE_SPEC document.
