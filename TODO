- Change scanner, parser, etc so we have a way of knowing an ASCII char from a number.
  - At the moment, we have no way to tell if a single digit is a char or an integer.
  - A possible way is to leave the single quotes around the tokens value.
  - The best way is to actually add :character as a valid token type, but this may
    add complexity to the grammar...
  - See method "validate_and_format_args" in ./lib/asm/procedures.rb
    - It needs to use a regex to check for non-numeric values.

- Design/implement more primitive procedures:
     DMUL 1, 2, 3  -- Multiply the contents of r1 and r2, store the result in r3.

- Variables (immutable):
     A = 56
     LOAD 2, A

- Floating-point numbers:
     LOAD 4, 3.14
